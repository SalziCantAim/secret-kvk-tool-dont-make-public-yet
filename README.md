## Salzi's note

I swear to god this is the worst coding you have seen this is so embarrassing

also yeah I cba really making specific folders for this shit rn

Theres a good chance most of this wont work btw just saying okay

if you just want to try the .exe just download the repo and only use the "the exe" as your folder or rename it idk that should work tho

Enter the following command to
1) Install uv
